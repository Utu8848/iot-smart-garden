# Smart Garden System: Enhancing Plant Care Through IoT and Sensor Technology

A **Smart Garden System** designed and simulated using **Tinkercad**, leveraging **IoT** and **sensor technology** to automate plant care. The system integrates various sensors like **soil moisture**, **temperature**, **humidity**, **LDR** (Light Dependent Resistor), and **PIR** (Passive Infrared) to monitor environmental conditions in real-time. Actuators such as **DC motors**, **servo motors**, **LEDs**, and **buzzers** were programmed in **C++** to automate watering, lighting, and security alerts.

## üå± Key Features

1. **Automated Irrigation**: Soil moisture sensors trigger servo motors to optimize water usage (SDG 6: Clean Water).
2. **Climate Control**: Temperature/humidity sensors maintain ideal conditions for plant growth (SDG 2: Zero Hunger).
3. **Energy Efficiency**: LDR sensors adjust artificial grow lights, reducing energy waste (SDG 7: Affordable Clean Energy).
4. **Urban Sustainability**: Promotes green spaces in cities (SDG 11: Sustainable Cities).
5. **Resource Conservation**: Minimizes water and energy waste (SDG 12: Responsible Consumption).
6. **Future Enhancements**: Cloud logging, mobile app integration, and machine learning for predictive plant care.
